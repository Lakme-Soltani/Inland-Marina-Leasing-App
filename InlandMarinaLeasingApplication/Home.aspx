        <p>&nbsp;<p>Welcome to Inland Marina located on the south shore Inland Lake, just a small commute from major centers in the south west.<p>&nbsp;<p/>
           Inland Marina was established in the 1967 shortly after Inland Lake was created as a result of the South West dam.
               <p/>
                   From its humble beginnings, it has grown to be the largest marina on Inland Lake. <p/>
                   &nbsp;<p/>
                   Due to the warm climate that extends year-round,
                   Inland Lake has become a popular tourist destination in the south west.
               <p/>
                   Boat owners from California, Arizona, Nevada, and Utah are attracted to the area.<p/>
                   &nbsp;<p/>
                  Inland Marina has 90 slips ranging in size from 16 to 32 feet in length.<p> Dock services include electrical and fresh water.<p/>
